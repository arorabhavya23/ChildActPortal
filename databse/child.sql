	(4, 'The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012', 'The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, has been passed by the Lok Sabha today, 22nd May, 2012. The Bill was earlier passed by the Rajya Sabha on 10th May, 2012. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 has been drafted to strengthen the legal provisions for the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation. For the first time, a special law has been passed to address the issue of sexual offences against children. Sexual offences are currently covered under different sections of IPC. The IPC does not provide for all types of sexual offences against children and, more importantly, does not distinguish between adult and child victims.\r\nThe Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years and provides protection to all children under the age of 18 years from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. These offences have been clearly defined for the first time in law. The Act provides for stringent punishments, which have been graded as per the gravity of the offence. The punishments range from simple to rigorous imprisonment of varying periods. There is also provision for fine, which is to be decided by the Court.\r\nAn offence is treated as "aggravated" when committed by a person in a position of trust or authority of child such as a member of security forces, police officer, public servant, etc.\r\nPunishments for Offences covered in the Act are:\r\n•	Penetrative Sexual Assault (Section 3) - Not less than seven years which may extend to imprisonment for life, and fine (Section 4)\r\n•	Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault (Section 5) - Not less than ten years which may extend to imprisonment for life, and fine (Section 6)\r\n•	Sexual Assault (Section 7) - Not less than three years which may extend to five years, and fine (Section 8)\r\n•	Aggravated Sexual Assault (Section 9) - Not less than five years which may extend to seven years, and fine (Section 10)\r\n•	Sexual Harassment of the Child (Section 11) - Three years and fine (Section 12)\r\n•	Use of Child for Pornographic Purposes (Section 13) - Five years and fine and in the event of subsequent conviction, seven years and fine (Section 14 (1))\r\nThe Act provides for the establishment of Special Courts for trial of offences under the Act, keeping the best interest of the child as of paramount importance at every stage of the judicial process. The Act incorporates child friendly procedures for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and trial of offences. These include:\r\n•	Recording the statement of the child at the residence of the child or at the place of his choice, preferably by a woman police officer not below the rank of sub-inspector\r\n•	No child to be detained in the police station in the night for any reason.\r\n•	Police officer to not be in uniform while recording the statement of the child\r\n•	The statement of the child to be recorded as spoken by the child\r\n•	Assistance of an interpreter or translator or an expert as per the need of the child\r\n•	Assistance of special educator or any person familiar with the manner of communication of the child in case child is disabled\r\n•	Medical examination of the child to be conducted in the presence of the parent of the child or any other person in whom the child has trust or confidence.\r\n•	In case the victim is a girl child, the medical examination shall be conducted by a woman doctor.\r\n•	Frequent breaks for the child during trial\r\n•	Child not to be called repeatedly to testify\r\n•	No aggressive questioning or character assassination of the child\r\n•	In-camera trial of cases\r\nThe Act recognizes that the intent to commit an offence, even when unsuccessful for whatever reason, needs to be penalized. The attempt to commit an offence under the Act has been made liable for punishment for up to half the punishment prescribed for the commission of the offence. The Act also provides for punishment for abetment of the offence, which is the same as for the commission of the offence. This would cover trafficking of children for sexual purposes.\r\nFor the more heinous offences of Penetrative Sexual Assault, Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault, Sexual Assault and Aggravated Sexual Assault, the burden of proof is shifted on the accused. This provision has been made keeping in view the greater vulnerability and innocence of children. At the same time, to prevent misuse of the law, punishment has been provided for making false complaint or proving false information with malicious intent. Such punishment has been kept relatively light (six months) to encourage reporting. If false complaint is made against a child, punishment is higher (one year).\r\nThe media has been barred from disclosing the identity of the child without the permission of the Special Court. The punishment for breaching this provision by media may be from six months to one year. For speedy trial, the Act provides for the evidence of the child', '\\images\\d1.jpg', '\\images\\d2.jpg', 'POCSO-ACT-Gazette.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(5, 'The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009', 'In 2005 the Central Advisory Board of Education drafted the Right to Education (RTE) Bill, and sent it to the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) for review. The MHRD in turn sent it to the National Advisory Council and the Prime Minister. The bill spent three years being scrutinized by the union government, government ministers and the public. In 2008 there was a new draft placed before and in September 2009 it was passed by the Union Cabinet, and hence became The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. The main purpose of the act is to outline the provision of quality education for all children between the ages of 6-14 as per the constitutional fundamental right awarded to children in the 86th amendment.\r\nIn the first chapter the act states that the act once passed by the central government would be applicable to the entirety of India except Jammu and Kashmir. Chapter one also defines a number of key terms used in the act. Two terms of utmost important are 1. Appropriate government: is the central, state or union territory government which is directly in charge of a particular school or area; 2. Local Authority: is a Municipal Corporation or Municipal Council or Zila Parishad or Nagar Panchayat or Panchayat. The act has seven chapters that outline the various powers, roles and responsibilities of the central, state, district and local authorities, as well as teachers and school administrators.\r\nChapter two is the provisions of the act that calls for free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 6 and 14. It provides for equal opportunities of disabled children. It makes special provisions for children who are not admitted and are above age 6 to be admitted into their age appropriate class, after special training and provides that they be allowed to complete their elementary education even pass the age of 14. Any child also has the right to transfer to a school that provides education up to class VIII if it is not provided in the school she is currently enrolled in.\r\nChapter three begins with a provision that the central and state governments are responsible for establishing schools where one is not available, in every area or neighbourhood. It outlines that the central and state governments share the responsibility both financial and other (such as development of curriculum, training of teachers, etc) required under this act. The appropriate government is responsible for providing free and compulsory education to all children, except those who would choose to enrol in private/ unaided schools. It must ensure no discrimination against children from educationally and socially backward groups, availability of a neighbourhood school, provide necessary infrastructure, provide good quality education, ensure completion of elementary school, and provide curriculum and teachers training. The local authority shares the above responsibilities as well as in charge of the academic calendar, education of children of migrant families, functioning of the school and maintaining a record of all children up to fourteen years of age in its jurisdiction.\r\nLastly it is the responsibility of parents to send their children to school and the appropriate government (which is directly in charge of a school or area) to provide pre- primary (between ages 3-6) education and child care.\r\nIn chapter four of the act there is an outline of school and teacher responsibilities. A government school is required to provide free education to any child that seeks admission. Aided schools, private schools and special schools are required to provide free education to a minimum of 25% of its students especially those from disadvantaged sections of society. In return the government is responsible to reimburse private schools the cost per child that a public school incurs to help aid the free education provided by such schools. But if the private school has received any sort of concession or subsidy they are not entitled to such reimbursement.\r\nSchools are not allowed to charge capitation fees, screen the children for admission and even though they are allowed to ask for proof of age they may not deny admission on the basis of lack of proof. No school may hold back or expel a child before their completion of elementary education. There is a prohibition against physical punishment and mental harassment, which if broken is liable to disciplinary action. All schools must be registered or given a certificate of recognition by the appropriate government in order to function. This certificate will only be given or maintained if certain norms and standards are upheld. The government can levy charges up to one lakh against schools for continuing to function without a certificate. At this point it is conveniently added that the central government has the power to change these said "norms and standards" (given in the schedule at the end of the act) at any point.\r\n ', '\\images\\e1.jpg', '\\images\\e2.jpg', 'RTE,2009.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(6, 'Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000', 'The Government of India enacted the Juvenile Justice Act in 1986. In 1989 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of a Child. India ratified the UNCRC in 1992. The convention outlines the right of the child to reintegration into society without judicial proceedings where avoidable. Hence the Government, to fulfil the standards of the convention felt a need to re-write the law. Hence in 2000 the old law was replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.\r\n\r\nIn this act a child or juvenile is defined as a person who has not completed his/her 18th year of age. It outlines two target groups: Children in need of care and protection and Juveniles in conflict with law. This act protects not only the rights of children, but a person\'s rights when he/she was a child. Meaning that if a crime or an incident took place while the person was a child, and then during the proceeding the juvenile ceased to be of age the case would continue as if the juvenile has not turned eighteen yet.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter of the Act addresses Juveniles in Conflict with Law (JCLs). This section calls for the establishment of Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) where the State Government sees fit. JJBs must contain a Metropolitan or Judicial magistrate and two social workers where one of the workers must be a woman. The magistrate is required to have a background in child psychology or child welfare. JCL cases can only be heard in the JJB and not by another court. The powers of the JJB can be exercised in a High court or Court of Session when an appeal has been made as part of the act, the state is required to set up a number of institutions where the needs and protection of juveniles may be fulfilled. For the reception and rehabilitation of JCLs the state must set up Observation Homes and Special Homes in ever district or group of districts. The state may directly set up these homes or contract a voluntary organisation to do so. Observation homes are for institutions for juveniles while their proceedings are underway. After the proceedings of a particular case are complete, the JJB may decide that the rehabilitation of the child is not complete and hence place them in a Special home for no longer than three years.  \r\n\r\nWhen a police officer comes in contact with a juvenile he must place the child with the Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) who must report the child to the board without delay. Bail is available to juveniles in all cases as long as the Board find the release of this child will not place him in any danger or in the influence of criminals. If the child is not released on bail he is only to be placed into the custody of an Observation Home. The SJPU are responsible for informing the juvenile\'s parents of the arrest, as well as inform the Probation Officer who will make the necessary enquires about the child.\r\n\r\nThe JJB must make an inquiry into the case and if they determine the child is guilty of the crime then they may release the child after advice and counselling. The child can be released either to his parents/guardians or into an institution, with or without a bond. The Board may also make the child pay a fine (if he is above fourteen and earns) or complete hours of community service. A social investigation report from the probation officer is required for the child to be discharged. The probation officers may be required to continue a follow up of the child even after discharge. A child can not be charged with the death penalty, imprisonment which can extend to life imprisonment or committed to prison for inability to pay a fine or providing a security for the bond.\r\n\r\nUnder this act juvenile cases can not be processed with non-juvenile cases. A juvenile can not be rendered unfit or \'disqualified". Juveniles are not exposed to the media as magazines, news papers and visual media are not permitted to release the information about the juvenile. Juveniles who run away from the Observation or Special homes can be brought back without a warrant and without punishment. Cruelty (such as assault or neglect) towards juveniles in the home or by any person in charge of him/her is a punishable offence. This act also has provisions to penalize people who exploit children for a crime. A person, who employs a child in a hazardous industry, employs him/her for begging or provides a child with drugs or alcohol is liable to serve prison time and pay fines.\r\n\r\nChapter III address Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP). In place of a JJB, CNCP cases are heard by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). The committee is meant to have a chairperson and four other members of whom at least one should be a woman and at least one expert in children\'s issues. The purpose of the CWC is to provide for the care, treatment, protection, rehabilitation and development of the child and in doing so uphold the rights of the child.', '\\images\\f1.jpg', '\\images\\f2.jpg', 'The-Juvenile-Justice-Care-And-Protection-Of-Children-Act-2015.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(7, 'Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986', 'The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 is one the most debated acts regarding children in India. It outlines where and how children can work and where they can not. The provisions of the act are meant to be acted upon immediately after the publication of the act, except for part III that discusses the conditions in which a child may work. Part III can only come into effect as per a date appointed by the Central Government (which was decided as 26th of May, 1993).\r\n\r\nThe act defines a child as any person who has not completed his fourteenth year of age. Part II of the act prohibits children from working in any occupation listed in Part A of the Schedule; for example: Catering at railway establishments, construction work on the railway or anywhere near the tracks, plastics factories, automobile garages, etc. The act also prohibits children from working in places where certain processes are being undertaken, as listed in Part B of the Schedule; for example: beedi making, tanning, soap manufacture, brick kilns and roof tiles units, etc. These provisions do not apply to a workshop where the occupier is working with the help of his family or in a government recognised or aided school.\r\n\r\nThe act calls for the establishment of a Child Labour Technical Advisory Committee (CLTAC) who is responsible for advising the government about additions to the Schedule lists.\r\nPart III of the act outlines the conditions in which children may work in occupations/processes not listed in the schedule. The number of hours of a particular kind of establishment of class of establishments is to be set and no child can work for more than those many hours in that particular establishment. Children are not permitted to work for more than three hour stretches and must receive an hour break after the three hours. Children are not permitted to work for more than six hour stretches including their break interval and can not work between the hours of 7 p.m. and 8 a.m. No child is allowed to work overtime or work in more than one place in a given day. A child must receive a holiday from work every week. The employer of the child is required to send a notification to an inspector about a child working in their establishment and keep a register of all children being employed for inspection.\r\n\r\nIf there is a dispute as to the age of the child, the inspector can submit the child for a medical exam to determine his/her age when a birth certificate is not available. Notices about prohibition of certain child labour and penalties should be posted in every railway station, port authority and workshop/establishment.\r\n\r\nThe health conditions of work being undertaken by children shall be set for each particular kind of establishment of class of establishments by the appropriate government. The rules may cover topics such as cleanliness, light, disposal of waste and effluents, drinking water, bathrooms, protection of eyes, maintenance and safety of buildings, etc.\r\nSection IV of the act outlines various remaining aspects such as Penalties. The penalty of allowing a child to work in occupations/ processes outlined in the schedule which are prohibited is a minimum of 3 months prison time and/or a minimum of Rs. 10,000 in fines. Second time offenders are subject to jail time of minimum six months. Failure to notify an inspector, keep a register, post a sign or any other requirement is punishable by simple imprisonment and/or a fine up to Rs. 10,000. Offenders can only be tried in courts higher than a magistrate or metropolitan magistrate of the first class. Courts also have the authority to appoint people to be inspectors under this act.\r\n\r\nRules of this act must be passed by the respective parliaments (state or central). Any changes or added provisions must be passed by the parliament. The establishment of this act also calls for a change in a number of other acts. The Employment of Children Act of 1938 is repealed. The enactment of this act changes the definition of child to one who has not completed his fourteenth year of age. Hence under provisions of this act the age of a child is also changed in the Minimum Wages Age 1948, the Plantations Labour Act 1951, the Merchant Shipping Act 1958, and the Motor Transport Workers Act 1961.\r\n', '\\images\\g1.jpg', '\\images\\g2.jpg', 'THE-CHILD-LABOUR-PROHIBITION-AND-REGULATION-AMENDMENT-ACT-2016.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(8, 'Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976', 'In 2002, UNICEF issued a press release about the shocking number of children working. The latest ILO report stated that every one in six children work, with millions engaged in bonded or forced labour. Article 23(1) of the Indian Constitution bans "beggar" and other forms of forced labour.   The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 talks of the illegality of slave or bonded labour with reference to both adults and children. In the following section is an outline of the law as it pertains to children below the age of 18. This law does not outline a more severe punishment for offences committed against a child.\r\nThe act renders all bonded labour systems (agreements, pacts, tradition, custom, etc) to be null and void and hence frees all bonded labours from their debt to the creditors. It also bans any person shall pursue or compel a person to enter into forced labour or a bonded labour system. Victims of bonded labour are not liable to repay their debt, and any property that was taken from the bonded labourer is to be restored. All legal proceeding against bonded labourers for inability to replay their debt or abide by the bonded system are dismissed. As per the law, the bonded labour can not be evicted from his home even when the bonded system has been dissolved. Creditors are not permitted to accept any payments and those who do are punishable up to three years of imprisonment and fine.\r\nThe act allows for the state to appoint a district magistrate and officers authorised by him to over see the legal implementation of the act. It also requires that the state set up vigilance committees in every district or sub-section. These committees are responsible for ensuring the full rehabilitation and recovery of all bonded labourers, defending any suit against a bonded labourer and advising the district magistrate to take action and uphold the law. The act maintains that burden of proof lies on the creditor to prove a particular debt is not bonded in nature.\r\nAny per who extends an advance on bonded labour is liable to imprisonment up to three years and a fine up to Rs. 2000. In addition to this punishment, a person who extracts bonded labour in the form of a bonded system from an individual is liable to pay that individual Rs 5 for every day of labour extracted out of the fine. The same punishment is levied against any individual who fails to return property to a bonded labourer that was procured as part of the bonded system. A person who had abetted an offence is also liable to the same punishment as a person who has committed the offence.\r\nUnder this act all offences are to be tried by an executive magistrate that has the powers of a second or first class judicial magistrate, appointed by the state government. Companies who commit bonded labour offences are held responsible as well as the person in charge of the conduct of the business are also held responsible. \r\n', '\\images\\h1.jpg', '\\images\\h2.jpg', 'Bonded_Labour_System_(Abolition)_Act_1976_and_Rules.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(9, 'Factories Act, 1948', 'The factories act is an extensive and lengthy act that covers an endless number of concerns for labour working in factories. The following is an overview of provisions in the act that are relevant to children ages 0-18.The act defines a child as a person who has completed him/her 15th year of age. It defines an adolescent as one who is has completed his/her15th year of age but not completed his/her 18th year of age. A young person is defined as either a child or an adolescent. According to this act it is the duty of a certified medical practitioner or surgeon to examine and medical condition and certifies all young people working in the factory. These examinations take place where a young person is or is going to be engaged in work that is injurious to his health. Under this act a young person may not clean or lubricate the parts of any moving machinery that is likely to cause them injury.\r\nSection 23 is concerned with the employment of young persons on dangerous machinery. Young persons are not to be compelled to work dangerous machinery unless they have full prior knowledge of the danger, are trained and there is a supervisor present at all times who is fully trained in the machinery. Children are prohibited from working in any area where a cotton opener is functional. The act calls for a cr?che service to be available to children below the age of six with the factory has a minimum of 30 women working there.\r\nChapter VII of the act concerns the employment of young persons. This section states that no child below the age of fourteen will be allowed or required to work in a factory. It requires that all non-adult workers or adolescents carry tokens that show that they have been deemed medically fit by a certifying surgeon. The certificate of fitness is given for a 12 month period, and can be revoked at any point if the child is found not to be medically fit anymore. The certificate also deem an adolescent to be treated as an adult as per certain provisions of this act. An adolescent who has not been deemed an adult for provisions of this act shall be considered a child.\r\nThe act places time restrictions to the work of adolescents who have been granted a certificate to work as adults. Adolescents are only allowed to work in the factory between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. unless the State Government decides otherwise. Children or adolescents who have not been deemed adults shall not be allowed to work in a factory for more than four and half hours in any day and can not work at night.

He/She can carry forth forty unused leave days to the next calendar year. A child who has been granted five or more days leave can collect the wages for those days before the leave. Parents/Guardians of a child can be fined for allowing the child to work in two factories in the same day. Adolescents and children are not permitted to work in the manufacturing process or any other dangerous environment in a factory.\r\nIn 2005 the Ministry of Labour proposed an amendment bill that has yet to be passed. It was reintroduced in 2009 but was still not passed.

	(10, 'Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods', 'Malnutrition is responsible for 55% of the infant mortality seen in India. Breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of an infant\'s life and complementary feeding up to two years age is essential to battle malnutrition. The purpose of the Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods Act 1992 and its 2003 amendment is to promote breast feeding of new born children and infants. It also looks to ensure that infant foods are regulated and used appropriately.\r\n\r\nFrom the second section of the act it is important to remember two essential definitions. Infant Food refers to the food that is marketed, or represented as complementary to mother\'s milk to provide the nutritional needs of the infant after 6 months up to 2 years. Infant milk substitute is any food being marketed or represented as partial or full replacement for mother\'s milk for the infant up to 2 years of age.\r\n\r\nThis act states that no person should advertise, promote or mislead people to believe that infant food, feeding bottles and infant milk substitutes are an acceptable replacement of mother\'s milk. No person can distribute or supply infant food, feeding bottles and infant milk substitutes, or contact any expecting mother or mother of an infant, or offer inducement in an attempt to sell or promote infant food, feeding bottles and infant milk substitutes. Section five states, no person shall donate or distribute infant food, feeding bottles and infant milk substitutes or any material regarding the same, except the health system.\r\n\r\nThe law requires that any manufacturer, supplier or distributer of infant food and infant milk substitutes needs to put warning labels on the project insuring that the customer understands that mother\'s milk is the best food for an infant, and that these products should only be used under the advice of a healthcare worker. The product should also give clear instructions for use, nutritional information, ingredients and manufacture and expiry information, etc. Infant food and infant milk substitute products are not permitted to have photos of babies or mothers, images or designs that increase saleability, and use words like maternalised or humanised, etc.\r\n\r\nInformational or educational material that is used to promote milk substitutes or infant food, should have labels professing the superiority of breast feeding, the harmful effects of bottle feeding, the difficulty in switching back from bottle feeding, the social and financial implications of using milk substitutes or infant food, the health risks to using milk substitutes or infant food and proper publication information. No person can promote the use of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant food through any facility in the health case system such as posters, placards,\r\n\r\nThere are a few institutions that are exempted from the distribution of these products such as an orphanage, Health care workers, organisations engaged in care for mothers who can not breast feed, etc. There is a provision in the act to ward of bribing of health care workers to promote the use of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant food by banning any payment in cash or kind to any health worker or organisation. Employees of producers, suppliers or distributers are not allowed to receive any bonuses on the bases of sales and are not allowed to contact expecting mothers or mothers of infants.\r\n\r\nAll products being sold or distributed have to meet the standards of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, or the Bureau of Indian Standards or in the absence of a standard then that specified by the central government. Offers appointed under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 can search any premise if they suspect that the provisions of this act are being violated.

The owner is given a formal letter explaining why the products have been seized and hence has time to object the confiscation. The decision of the civil courts may be appealed to the appellate court.

	(11, 'Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994', 'Sex selection is a deep rooted problem in India. Families who discriminate against girl children prefer to abort the child before it is born. The boy child is preferred since he will carry on the family name, provides for the elders and is not a burden on the family at the time of marriage. In 1994 the Government of India in an attempt to stop female foeticide passed the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act. In 2002 the act was amended. Following is an overview of the act in its amended form.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the provisions of this act it is important to know two definitions as given in the act. Embryo refers to a developing human organism after fertilization till the fifty-sixth day. Foetus refers to a developing human organism from the fifty-seventh day after fertilization till birth. The act firstly outlines provisions about the regulation of genetic counselling clinics, genetic laboratories and genetic clinics. All such clinics have to be registered under this act, and all medical professionals employed must have the appropriate qualification to conduct pre-natal diagnostic techniques.\r\n\r\nThe act prohibits the medical personnel from conducting or helping anyone conduct sex-selection. All medical equipment regarding pregnancies shall be sold only to registered clinics. All pre-natal diagnostic techniques are banned except for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities, genetic metabolic diseases, haemoglobinopathies, sex-linked genetic diseases, congenital anomalies, any other abnormalities or diseases as may be specified by the Central Supervisory Board; only as long as there is a potential threat to the child as outlined in the act. No person is allowed to divulge the sex of a child in any form of communication, no clinic or person is allowed to conduct sex determination tests, and no person shall commit the act or sex selection or aid in doing so.\r\n\r\nThe act calls for the formation of a Central Supervisory Board and outlines all logistically matters concerning the board. The purpose of the board is to advise the central government regarding sex selection techniques, to insure the implementation of the act, to create public awareness about the act, to lay down a code of conduct for clinics, etc. Similarly State and Union Territory Supervisory Boards will also be created. The will aim at creating awareness, and review the actions of all authorities regarding pre-natal diagnostics.\r\n\r\nEach state and union territory will also have an \'Appropriate Authority\' appointed, who will be responsible for registration and maintenance of clinics in their jurisdiction. They must also enforce codes to be observed by clinics, investigate violations of this act, take legal action against violators, advise the supervisory boards on changes in technology, etc. They have the power to issue warrants, summon people with information, and ask for any document to be produced regarding the information. To aid the Appropriate Authority the government will also form an Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nThe act has a section that lists all offences and their penalties that can be committed under this act. Under this act is it also an offence to advertise techniques used for the purpose of sex-determination. People who contravene the provisions of this act are liable to serve prison time and a fine. But women who have been forced to by their husband or family to undergo pre-natal diagnostic techniques will not be prosecuted under this act.

	(12, 'Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995', 'In 1992, India adopted the Proclamation on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region. As a signatory of this proclamation, India\'s Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs proposed an act to safe guard the rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD). On the 1st of January 1996 the Government of India passed the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1995. The following is an outline of the provisions in this law that pertains to children below the age of 18.\r\n\r\nIn this act disability is defined as blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impairment, loco-motor disability, mental retardation and mental illness. The act calls for the forming of two central committees and two state committees: The central coordination committee and the central executive committee; the state coordination committee and the state executive committee. The coordination committees are responsible for insuring the rights of the PWD by advising the correct bodies about changes that need to be made in policy and programmes with regard to the rights of PWDs These committees are the central and state respectively focal points on disability matters. The respective executive committees are responsible for carrying out the decisions of the larger coordination committee.\r\n\r\nThe act calls for the government to take the necessary steps to ensure the prevention of disabilities. In accordance with this agenda, the government must screen all the children at least once a year to determine risk factors that lead to disability and attempt to protect the child from such factors. It is also necessary for the state to take measure to reduce risks to prenatal and post natal mothers and child.\r\n\r\nAccording to chapter V, children with disabilities should be provided free education by the appropriate government. The government must take steps to integrate children with disabilities into regular schools, but also make space for special schools that cater expressly to the needs of these children. In addition to the basic education schools, government are also required to make non-formal education programmes for children with disabilities that help attain literacy, rejoin school, impart vocational training, and provide them with free books and educational material. Teachers need to be specially trained to educate and see to the needs of children with disabilities. The government must also set up schemes that provide children with disabilities grant and scholarships and also provide funds for making buildings disabled friendly. Educational institutions are also required to provide visually challenged students with aids who will write for them.\r\n\r\nThe government is also responsible for making the general environment non-discriminatory towards PWD by adapting and adding to railways, buses, road signals pavement slopes, warning signals, building ramps, Braille signs and auditory signals, etc. The act also provides for non-discrimination of PWD in employment that can be taken up by them, in government and non-government offices. Institutions that aid people with disabilities are required to be registered by the government and the government is also required to set up a number of institutions to cater to the needs of people with severe disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe act calls for the appointment of a chief commissioner who will hear complaints or pleas made with regard to the deprivation of rights of PWD. It is also the governments\' economic responsibility to take care of any PWD who can not provide for themselves or does not have family support system to do so through unemployment allowances. Under this act there are also penalties doled out to people without disabilities who use services meant for PWD.\r\n\r\nIn October 2007, India ratified the United Nations Convention for Rights of Persons with Disability. Since then advocates of PWD rights have been calling for an amendment of the PWD act so that it better aligns with the provisions of the convention.', '\\images\\l1.jpg', '\\images\\l2.jpg', 'DisabilitiesRules1996.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(13, 'Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006', 'Child marriage has been an issue in India for a long time. Because of its root in traditional, cultural and religious practises it has been a hard battle to fight. Child marriage is also associated with other problems like dowry and child widowhood. It is also associated with malnutrition, poor health of mothers and high fertility and hence over-population. The following is an overview of the act.\r\n\r\nAccording to the act a child is a male who has not completed twenty one years of age and a female who has not completed eighteen years of age. Child marriage is a contract between any two people of which either one or both parties is a child. Child marriage that took place before or after this act can be made void by the person who was a child at the time of marriage. But the marriage must be voided before the person who was a child completes their second year of maturity.\r\n\r\nA court can decree that if it is the husband that is asking for a void of marriage than he or his family are responsible to pay for the maintenance of the girl until she is remarried. The amount of maintenance is to be determined by the district court. If there were any children born of the marriage, it is the court discretion as to where the child shall reside, with which parent, and how visits will be organised all in the best interest of the child. The court may also decide for one of the parties to provide maintenance for the child. Every child conceived before the voiding of the marriage is considered a legitimate child.\r\n\r\nIf a male adult above eighteen years contracts a child marriage shall be punishable unto two years imprisonment and/or a fine with may extend to Rs. 1 lakh. The same punishment will be given to person who performs, conducts or directs a child marriage. Unless proved otherwise, the parents or guardian of the child are considered to have failed to prevent the child marriage and hence are also held accountable.\r\n\r\nThere are certain situations in which a child marriage is deemed void even without a petition from one of the parties. If a child was detained away from her/his parents or guardians, forced to go to a different place, sold into marriage, or made to marry after which they are used for immoral purposes or trafficked then that marriage is considered to be null and void. The court has the power after the application of an officer or any person to issue an injunction prohibiting a suspected child marriage against any person, including a member of an organisation or an association of people. The court may also act against a suspected child marriage on its own motion but must provide the person/association with time to respond to the injunction. Ignoring a notice or injunction is a punishable offence. If the marriage is still carried out after the injunction, it is automatically voided.\r\n\r\nThe act calls for the instatement of a Child Marriage Prohibition Officer, who is responsible for ensuring no child marriage takes place in their jurisdiction by approaching the courts for an injunction, collecting evidence against people, creating awareness about the negative effects of child marriage, collect data concerning child marriages, etc. A child marriage prohibition officer is deemed a public servant in this act.\r\n\r\nRules of this act are to be made by the respective state governments. The act calls for the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to be amended to meet its provisions as well as the repeal of The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.', '\\images\\m1.jpg', '\\images\\m2.jpg', 'Child_Marriage_Act_2006.pdf', NULL, NULL),
	(14, 'Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1986', 'In 1950 the Government of India ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of others. In 1956 India passed the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA). The act was further amended and changed in 1986, resulting in the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act also know as PITA.  Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1986 PITA only discusses trafficking in relation to prostitution and not in relation to other purposes of trafficking such as domestic work, child labour, organ harvesting, etc. The following is an outline of the provisions in this law that pertains to children below the age of 18.\r\n\r\nThe act defines child as any person who has completed eighteen years of age. The first section of the act has provisions that outline the illegality of prostitution and the punishment for owning a brothel or a similar establishment, or for living of earnings of prostitution as is in the case of a pimp. Section five of the act states that if a person procures, induces or takes a child for the purpose of prostitution then the prison sentence is a minimum of seven years but can be extended to life. To ensure that the people in the chain of trafficking are also held responsible the act has a provision that states that any person involved in the recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring, or receiving of persons for the purpose of prostitution if guilty of trafficking. In addition any person attempting to commit trafficking or found in the brothel or visiting the brothel is punishable under this law.\r\n\r\nIf a person if found with a child it is assumed that he has detained that child there for the purpose of sexual intercourse and hence shall be punishable to seven year in prison up to life imprisonment, or a term which may extend to ten year and also a maximum fine of one lakh rupees. If a child is found in a brothel and after medical examination has been found to have been sexually abused, it is assumed that the child has been detained for the purpose of prostitution.\r\n\r\nAny person committing prostitution in public with a child shall be punishable to seven year in prison up to life imprisonment, or a term which may extend to ten year and also a maximum fine of one lakh rupees. If prostitution of a child is being committed with knowledge of an establishment owner such as a hotel the license of the hotel is likely to be cancelled along with the given prison sentence and/or fines.\r\n\r\nAny child found in a brothel or being abused for the purpose of prostitution can be placed in an institution for their safety by a magistrate. Landlords, leasers, owner, agent of the owner who unknowingly previously rented their property to a person found guilty of prostituting a child, must get approval from a magistrate before re-leasing their property for three years after the order is passed.', '\\images\\n1.jpg', '\\images\\n2.jpg', 'Immoral_Traffic_Prevention_act_1956.pdf', NULL, NULL),

It became the only non-religious universal law regarding the guardianship of a child, applicable to all of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This law is particularly outlined for Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews as their personal laws don\'t allow for full adoption only guardianship. It applies to all children regardless of race or creed. Following is an overview of the act.\r\nAccording to this act a minor/child is any person who has not completed 18 years of age. The court or appointed authority has the ability to decide the guardian of a child by appointing one a guardian or removing another as a guardian. No order will be passed without an application. Applications should contain all possible information about the child and guardian and reasons for guardianship. Once the court admits the application into court, then the court will set a date and hear evidence before making a decision. A minor and his property may have more than one guardian. The court must work in the interest of the minor’s, taking into consideration the age, sex, religion, character of the guardian, the death of the parent(s), relation of the child to the guardian, etc. The collector of the district where the minor lives can be appointed the guardian of the child. A minor will not appointed if the child or her/his property is under a court of wards, if the minor is married and her husband is fit to take care of her, or whose father is alive and is deemed fit to take care of her. Guardians are not meant to make a profit out of their office, but can receive remuneration as the court sees fit. A minor cannot be deemed a guardian of another minor. A guardian is responsible for the health, education and support of the ward. Guardians who wish to move the child out of the court’s jurisdiction may only do so with the permission of the court. Failure to get permission is a punishable offence. A guardian of property may not mortgage or sale the property of a ward without the permission of a will or the court who must act in the interest of the ward.\r\nA list of the wards property, immovable and movable, must be submitted by the guardian to the court. The court can allow the guardian to take funds from the property  for maintenance of the minor. A court may remove a guardian for abusing the trust of the court and not fulfilling his role. A person who no longer wishes to be a guardian can apply for a discharge. Other punishable Offences are: failure of the guard to produce the property of the ward, failure to produce the ward in court when requested, and failure to produce accounts. Reports produced by subordinates of the court or collector can be considered evidence by the court.

This act applies to Hindus and all those considered under the umbrella term of Hindus, which includes Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains.

Almost half the children under 5 years of age in India suffer from undernutrition.  Two million children die before they reach the age of five.  Out of that about one million die before the age of one month and two third of these deaths are related to inappropriate feeding practices. \r\nThe Right to food legislation in India is an innovative new social security scheme being introduced by the UPA Government. A food security act has the potential to change the face of poverty and hunger in India. The National Food Security Bill followed from the National Food Security Ordinance, 2013 that was promulgated by the Government of India on July 5.

	(19, 'The India Penal Code and Child related offenses', 'Indian Penal Code, 1860, sub-divided into twenty three chapters, comprises five hundred and eleven sections. The code starts with an introduction, provides explanations and exceptions used in the code, and covers a wide range of offences.\r\nThe objective of this Act is to provide a general penal code for India. Though an initial objective, the Act does not repeal the penal laws which were in force at the time of coming into force in India. This was so because the Code does not contain all the offences and it was possible that some offences might have still been left out of the Code, which was not intended to be exempted from penal consequences. Though this Code consolidates the whole of the law on the subject and is exhaustive on the matters in respect of which it declares the law, many more penal statutes governing various offences have been created in addition to the code.\r\nAccording to the sections 82 and 83 of the IPC a child who commits a crime and is below the age of seven is not considered to have committed a crime. A child who is between the ages of seven and twelve and is deemed to have immature understanding about the consequences of his/her actions is also considered incapable of committing a crime.\r\nSection 315 and 316 discusses the offence of foeticide and infanticide. If a person commits an act with the intention of preventing the child from being born alive or an act that results in the death of the child after birth, that person is committing foeticide/infanticide as long as they do not do it in the interest of the mother\'s health or life.\r\nSection 317 states that an exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it.\r\nThere are a number of sections in the IPC that discuss kidnapping and abduction. Section 360 states that kidnapping from India is the defined as the conveyance of a person beyond the borders of India without their consent. 361 states that if a male minor of not yet sixteen and female minor of not yet eighteen is taken from their lawful guardians without their consent it is termed kidnapping from lawful guardianship. Section 362 defines abduction as compelling, forcing or deceitfully inducing a person from a place.\r\nSexual offences against children are also covered in the IPC. Section 372 discusses the selling of a child (below the age of eighteen) for the purpose of prostitution or to illicit intercourse with any person, or knowing that it is likely that the child is being sold for such a purpose. Section 372 states it is a crime to buy a child for the purpose of prostitution or to illicit sex from any person. \r\nSection 376 discusses the offence of rape. Under this section a man who rapes his wife, who is not below twelve years old is given a lesser punishment. The section also discusses special circumstances of rape such as rape committed by a civil servant or police man, rape of a pregnant woman, gang rape or rape of a child below the age of twelve.\r\n', '\\images\\s1.jpg', '\\images\\s2.jpg', 'Indian_penal_code_1860.pdf', NULL, NULL);
